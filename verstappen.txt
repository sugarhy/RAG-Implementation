\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Max Verstappen is giggling like a third-grader while crashing a toy truck. The planet\'92s top\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://time.com/collection/time100-companies-2023/6285190/formula-one/"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \strokec3 Formula One}}\'a0driver, who\'92s won three straight world championships and crushed all comers during the 2023 season, is on the Austin campus of Oracle, the lead sponsor for his Red Bull racing team, in mid-October. As part of his responsibilities, Verstappen is pinballed from event to event, where he and his teammates must glad-hand Oracle employees and customers a few days before the United States Grand Prix, a regular stop on the F1 schedule that includes races in 20 countries. It\'92s the sort of stuff Verstappen, who\'92s happiest speeding more than 200 m.p.h. down a track, can grow tired of, fast.\
The day\'92s organizers have baked in a little childlike fun for the drivers, setting up a track on a grass field so Verstappen and his mates can race remote-controlled trucks. What was supposed to be friendly competition, however, has quickly devolved into a race to see who can inflict the most damage. At one point, Verstappen pushes his vehicle straight into a tire blockade, sending the top cover spiraling into the air. He then keeps driving the damaged car, which skitters around like a headless chicken.\
Even during this ridiculous exhibition, Verstappen is looking for an edge. He stands atop a van, so he can view more of the track below. \'93It just comes natural to me to start thinking about these little advantages,\'94 he says the next day, during an interview in the Red Bull hospitality area at the Circuit of the Americas, the site of the F1 race. \'93I like to win.\'94\'a0\
This season Verstappen, 26, has turned in one of the most dominating performances in Formula One history, already winning a record 17 Grand Prix races\'97breaking his own mark of 15 from a year ago\'97including 10 in a row, another F1 record. It\'92s a form he flashed nearly a decade ago, when Verstappen became the youngest ever driver to start, and win, an F1 race. But he struggled to turn in a consistent campaign while\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2020/5888433/lewis-hamilton/"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \strokec3 Lewis Hamilton}}, a seven-time world champ,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://time.com/lewis-hamilton-formula-one/"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \strokec3 was winning}}\'a0a quartet of consecutive titles. Now Verstappen has more than delivered on his early promise. \'93Max is a talent that comes once in a generation,\'94 says American racing legend Mario Andretti. \'93He\'92s a tiger inside.\'94\
He\'92s replaced\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://time.com/4604712/lewis-hamilton-interview-trump-rosberg-mercedes-teammate-black-lives-matter-and-his-formula-1-future/"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \strokec3 Hamilton}}\'a0as face of Formula One during a transformational time for the sport. F1 has exploded in popularity in recent years: it brought in $2.57 billion in revenue last year, up 44% since 2017. Thanks in large part to the Netflix series\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://time.com/5843839/best-documentaries/"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \strokec3 Formula 1: Drive to Survive}}, which premiered in 2019 and gives viewers a look at the glitzy locations, rocket-speed racing, and interpersonal rivalries, growth is particularly strong in the U.S., where it long failed to gain a stronghold. The U.S. Grand Prix is filled with 20- and 30-something fans who got into F1 because of what racing insiders call \'93the Netflix effect.\'94 Next, many of these gearheads will head to Las Vegas for F1\'92s grandest U.S. stand yet: the inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix, on Nov. 18, in what promises to be a spectacular nighttime sprint down the Strip. The city is projecting 105,000 spectators for each of the event\'92s three nights, which include practices, qualifying, and the race itself. According to one analysis from earlier this year, the estimated economic impact\'97$1.3 billion\'97will double that of the Super Bowl Las Vegas is hosting in early 2024.\
But is Verstappen the ideal ambassador for this new heady era? Unlike Hamilton, a regular at fashion weeks with a host of A-list pals\'97he\'92s producing an F1 movie starring Brad Pitt\'97Verstappen has little appetite for the sports-celebrity machine. \'93I have no desire to be able to hang out with famous movie stars,\'94 he says. He\'92s the most polarizing driver in the sport, with a focus on winning that can come across as cold. And while Verstappen\'92s loyal fans show up decked out in orange wherever he goes, over the past two seasons he\'92s won with such relative ease, it\'92s drained some drama from the races. In Austin, his supporters couldn\'92t drown out the boos that greeted him on the podium. F1\'92s fate may hinge on whether those jeers morph into an appreciation for his singular skills. \'93As great as Verstappen is,\'94 says Barton Crockett, senior research analyst for Rosenblatt Securities who covers Liberty Media, F1\'92s U.S.-based parent company, \'93right now he looks like the biggest risk to the business.\'94\
Racing courses through\'a0Verstappen\'92s veins. His Dutch father Jos drove in F1 from 1994 to 2003, collecting two podium finishes. His Belgian mother Sophie Kumpen was a champion go-karter. (They split in 2008.) Jos got Max a quad bike\'97a motorcycle with four large wheels\'97when he was 2, growing up in Belgium. He began go-karting before he was 5.\
Once young Max showed an affinity for racing, Jos went all in. He built the engines for Max\'92s karts, served as mechanic, and drove with his son, for 13 hours at a time, to tracks throughout Europe. If rain drenched a track, most families went home. Jos made Max keep practicing. \'93From a young age, I saw other kids running around, playing, not really thinking about the future,\'94 says Max. \'93But my dad, he had a plan. And I had to stick to the plan.\'94\
There were tense moments. \'93Sometimes he thought I was a bit lazy,\'94 says Max. \'93I definitely had arguments with my dad about it.\'94 When Max was 14, another driver passed him in a race near Naples. Instead of waiting to take back the lead, he tried a riskier move and crashed himself out of the race. Jos was furious. On the way home, Jos stopped at a gas station. \'93He wanted to talk, I didn\'92t want to talk,\'94 says Jos. \'93So I said, \'91If you don\'92t shut up, I\'92ll send you out.\'92\'94 Jos left Max at the gas station, before turning around to pick him up. He didn\'92t speak to Max for a week. Jos, who\'92s had a number of run-ins with the law including a conviction for a 1998 assault, has denied ever abusing Max. He tells TIME he hit him just once\'97on the helmet, before a race in England. \'93He needed that,\'94 says Jos, who points out that Max won that one.\'a0\
Verstappen graduated from karts to cars in 2014, when he joined Formula 3, the third-tier circuit, at 16. Helmut Marko, an influential Red Bull adviser, caught a few of his wins on TV. \'93He was on another planet,\'94 says Marko, who called Jos. \'93I said, \'91Jos, forget everything. We do Formula One.\'92\'94\'a0\
Verstappen spent the 2015 season with Scuderia Toro Rosso, then Red Bull\'92s junior team. At 17, he was the youngest driver ever to line up on the F1 grid, by nearly two years. In 2016, he was promoted to the main team. F1 driver Daniel Ricciardo, then his teammate, still remembers Verstappen\'92s first practice session. \'93He didn\'92t really care about taking a pragmatic approach,\'94 says Ricciardo. \'93He was like, \'91I\'92m just gonna go and drive this thing and try to drive the wheels off of it. If I crash, I crash.\'92\'94 Verstappen won.\
Competitors weren\'92t exactly enamored with an aggressive upstart who looked like a child. \'93Yeah, for sure, people were questioning it,\'94 Verstappen says. \'93But I don\'92t care. I\'92m not interested in other people\'92s opinions.\'94\'a0\
Verstappen made his fair share of mistakes in his early years. \'93He was such a raw diamond,\'94 says Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. \'93All the learning other drivers did in the lower categories, out of the spotlight, he did under the scrutiny of the world\'92s media.\'94\'a0\
Verstappen and Hamilton engaged in an epic duel in 2021; the season came down to the last lap in Abu Dhabi where Verstappen overtook Hamilton to win his first title. \'93Having achieved that world championship, it lifted a lot of pressure off his shoulders,\'94 Horner says.\'a0\
New regulations, designed to reduce the wake of \'93dirty air\'94 released by cars that made passing difficult, changed the look and feel of cars in the 2022 season. Red Bull turned in a superior aerodynamic design. Some opponents have cried foul. Last year, the FIA, the governing body of motor sports, fined Red Bull $7\'a0million for exceeding F1\'92s spending restrictions. Horner denies trying to gain any advantage. \'93There was a lot of pressure on the FIA after 2021, especially from our biggest competitor, to say, there\'92s a reason [why Red Bull won] and this and that and the other,\'94 he says. \'93The more you win, the less friends you have. We\'92ve done a lot of winning. So you can imagine, we don\'92t have a lot of friends.\'94 Mercedes, Hamilton\'92s team, declined to comment.\'a0\
At times, it\'92s almost too easy for Verstappen. During the first race of this season, in Bahrain, Hamilton and Fernando Alonso jockeyed for position behind Verstappen. Alonso finally passed Hamilton and finished third. Afterward, Marko told a victorious Verstappen he missed a battle behind him. Not true. \'93I saw it on TV,\'94 Verstappen responded. He was watching the race on the big screens scattered around the track.\
Verstappen also attributes his success to a happy home life. He\'92s dated Kelly Piquet, the daughter of three-time F1 champion Nelson Piquet, since 2020, and bonded with the 4-year-old daughter Piquet shares with Daniil Kvyat, the driver Verstappen replaced on the Red Bull roster. \'93I\'92m not the father, that\'92s not the aim,\'94 says Verstappen. \'93It\'92s always very important that she has a good relationship with her own father, which she has. But I see her every day when I\'92m at home. We get on very well. She\'92s very cute.\'94 \'a0\
But when he returns to his home in Monaco\'97and even to his hotel rooms during race weeks\'97it\'92s not like he takes a break from racing. His most fervent hobby is simulated racing; he even runs an e-sports team. \'93I watch other sports, but there\'92s nothing really that I\'92m really passionate about,\'94 he says. Piquet respects his side hustle but has her limits. \'93There have been times where I\'92ve been like, \'91OK, time to switch off,\'92\'94 she says. \'93You have to give a gentle reminder that the sun is shining outside and, you know, there are other things to do.\'94\
Verstappen has ascended\'a0a very different F1 from the one he entered in 2015. In January 2017 Liberty Media, the conglomerate that also owns SiriusXM and has a stake in Live Nation, completed its purchase of F1 for $8 billion. Under Liberty, F1 has modernized its marketing and taken a more proactive approach to social media: subscribers to F1\'92s YouTube channel, for example, have risen from 272,000 to 9.61 million, a near 3,500% spike.\
Liberty has also sought inroads in America. In the past F1 had staged races in Detroit, Dallas, Phoenix, Indianapolis, and the parking lot of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, but they all fell off the calendar.\'a0Drive to Survive\'a0has turned F1 figures into recognizable stars. \'93We used to come here, and it would be my wife at immigration that they were all looking for a selfie with,\'94 says Horner, who\'92s married to Geri Halliwell, a.k.a. Ginger Spice. \'93Now they go, \'91Hey, you\'92re the dude from\'a0Drive to Survive.\'92\'94\
Through the first 17 races of this season, ESPN\'92s platforms attracted an average of 1.15 million viewers, more than double the audiences of five years ago. Last year\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://time.com/6174064/formula-1-miami-grand-prix/"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \strokec3 F1 debuted a race in Miami}}, and six of the past seven North American races have sold out. Liberty has invested some $500 million in the Las Vegas Grand Prix, which will take place the weekend before Thanksgiving. An opening ceremony, headlined by will.i.am, Keith Urban, Journey, and others, will kick off the festivities. Liberty is building a 300,000-sq.-ft. paddock facility in the city; passes to the Bellagio Fountain Club, overlooking the race on Las Vegas Boulevard, are going for over $10,000. Rooms at the Cosmopolitan, with a racetrack view, cost nearly $7,000 a night. \'93One of the goals with Vegas is to raise the bar,\'94 says Liberty president and CEO Greg Maffei. \'93A night race down the Strip on a Saturday is going to be a whole other level of appeal and attraction and promotion for the United States audience, and the world audience.\'94\
The Vegas race, however, is missing a key ingredient: any real meaning. Verstappen clinched the championship on Oct.\'a07 in Qatar. While drivers jostling lower in the standings may intrigue hardcore fans, casual viewers on, say, the East Coast of the U.S.\'97where the race will start at 1\'a0a.m.\'97are unlikely to stay up. \'93I would get bored of it if I was watching,\'94 says Kevin Magnussen, a driver for Moneygram Haas, the only American-owned F1 team.\
Verstappen sees it differently. \'93The NBA survived when the Chicago Bulls were dominating,\'94 he says. \'93At the time, or even afterwards, people are like, \'91Oh, that was amazing.\'92 If you are a real fan of the sport, you should be able to appreciate a team doing very well.\'94\
Slight quibble: Michael Jordan\'92s teams, in the 1990s, won three of their six NBA titles on late game-winning shots, in tight series. They didn\'92t sweep every playoff series with ease. That\'92s what Verstappen\'92s doing now.\
Fans tired of Verstappen\'92s\'a0run may be pleased to know he\'92s considered leaving F1. He\'92s not waxing poetic about all-time records, like breaking the mark for most F1 titles in a career, seven, held by Hamilton and Michael Schumacher. \'93Would I like to win seven? Yeah, why not?\'94 he says. \'93But even if I don\'92t win seven, I know that there\'92s still so many more things in life than F1. I\'92m already very happy with what I have achieved.\'94\
Other forms of motor racing, like the endurance circuit\'97which has fewer events each year\'97intrigue him. \'93At one point you have to outweigh the success against just general quality of life,\'94 he says. \'93I feel like I\'92m living out of a bag, out of a hotel, all the time. At the moment that\'92s fine. I love driving. I love winning. But the older you get, maybe one day that\'92s not anymore what I want.\'94\
Verstappen\'92s also growing weary of F1\'92s focus on marketing, which has undoubtedly fattened his wallet (his contract reportedly pays him some $50\'a0million per year). \'93I would just keep in mind that the actual sport comes first, instead of the show,\'94 he says. \'93That, for me, is very important, and that eventually will also decide if I stay or not.\'94\'a0\
For a while, he wouldn\'92t participate in\'a0Drive to Survive.\'a0He thought it concocted drama. Even now, his involvement is minimal. \'93I don\'92t need to watch it because I know what happens,\'94 he says. \'93I\'92m also not very interested to hear from our neighbors how they saw their season. I know my side of the story. For me, that\'92s enough.\'94\'a0\
Verstappen is accommodating at the endless meet-and-greets in Austin. But there are only so many one can take. He\'92s asked to play rock, paper, scissors\'97twice. One guy asks for the Dutch pronunciation of\'a0Broadway\'a0and\'a0Brooklyn. Verstappen plays along, reluctantly. \'93I think it\'92s better just to pronounce it in English,\'94 he says.\
Marko, the Red Bull adviser, recognizes the need to cut back on Verstappen\'92s off-track obligations. \'93He doesn\'92t like doing it,\'94 he says. \'93I want to have a relaxed and happy Max. Maybe some less sponsors.\'94\
Still, Verstappen has a knack for staying focused on race day. About an hour before the start of the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin, Prince Harry stops by the Red Bull garage. Verstappen gives him a quick greeting. \'93I\'92m not a people pleaser,\'94 he says. \'93I mean, super nice guy. And it\'92s good to shake hands, say hello. But I\'92m here to do my job.\'94\
\'93He should have come earlier,\'94 quips Jos.\
Verstappen starts the race sixth but patiently climbs the leaderboard, despite some dissatisfaction. \'93Mate, these brakes are so sh-t compared to yesterday,\'94 he radios to his race engineer. \'93What a piece of crap.\'94 He snaps when his engineer updates him while he\'92s concentrating. \'93Please, no talking, I\'92m in the braking [zone],\'94 he yells at one point. With a few laps to go, the engineer informs him he has a 3.6-sec. lead over Hamilton. \'93No talking in the braking, man,\'94 Verstappen says. \'93F-ck!\'94\
After his victory, Verstappen notes that he was at least polite. \'93I said\'a0please\'a0when I asked.\'94\
I later mention those boobirds in the stands. \'93Yeah, very heartbroken,\'94 he says, with sarcasm and a smile. \'93The thing you have to remember is that when I\'92m walking off with the trophy, that\'92s the most important thing.\'94\'a0\
Does he have any message for those fans?\'a0\
\'93Nope. No. They don\'92t deserve it.\'94\'a0\
With that, he walks toward the Red Bull garage for a team debriefing. On to the next race. On to the next victory.\
