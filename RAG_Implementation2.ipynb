Verstappen\\'s rise as a talented driver and his replacement of Lewis Hamilton as the face of Formula One has garnered attention and interest. The Netflix series has turned Formula One figures into recognizable stars and has attracted a larger audience, especially in the United States. Additionally, under Liberty Media\\'s ownership, Formula One has taken a more proactive approach to social media, resulting in a significant increase in subscribers to its YouTube channel.
