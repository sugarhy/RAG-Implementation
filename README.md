This is a short implementation of Retrieval Augmented Generation in python, presented in the paper Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks [1] from 2020. 
I implemented a RAG pipeline using an OpenAI LLM with a Weaviate vector database and an OpenAI embedding model. LangChain was used for orchestration.

Questions and answers were based on a text data.
